In this folder you will find our jupyter notebook containing our code and comments. 
You will also find the output folder containing ower models and processed images. 
Finally, you will find the utils folder containing all the helpers files including one that we changed in order to add pre-processing. 

With all these elements and the data you can launch every cell in the notebook.
